# pi-os

An OS-level AI layer: press a global hotkey in **any** application,
type an instruction, and a [pi](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi) agent
already knows what you were looking at and has tools to act on it.

**Windows:** current shipping functionality. **macOS 14+:** native AppKit host with
a signed build-12 native Whisper glass interface with pinned control, persistent reader and conversational
follow-ups (installed; full parity not yet accepted); [build/run instructions](host-macos/README.md) and
[acceptance status](host-macos/STATUS.md). Computer-use parity is still gated by
the [migration plan](MACOS_MIGRATION.md).

Windows architecture:

```
Notepad, Explorer, Excel, browser, anything
        |
   Ctrl+Alt+Space
        |
        v
+---------------------------+      HTTP/JSON       +---------------------------+
|  C# host (hidden WPF)     | -------------------> |  node-harness             |
|  - pins context BEFORE    |   POST /invoke       |  - pi SDK AgentSession    |
|    the popup shows        | <------------------- |  - desktop tools          |
|  - prompt overlay         |  POST /tools/{name}  |  - observe/act loops      |
|  - screenshots, UIA, input|                      |    via pi extensions      |
+---------------------------+                      +---------------------------+
```

The core split:

- **C# host** = stable native substrate: hotkey, context pinning, screenshots,
  UI Automation, input primitives.
- **node-harness** = the intelligence: a real pi session that reasons, picks
  tools, and re-observes after actions.
- Everything rapidly changing lives on the node side or in sidecars — the host
  stays small.

## Repository layout

| Path | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `host-dotnet/` | C# solution: `WindowsHarness.Host` (WPF background app) + `WindowsHarness.Contracts` (shared schema types) |
| `host-macos/` | Native Swift/AppKit host, SCK, gated input, model settings and lazy Node supervision (parity candidate) |
| `node-harness/` | Node service: HTTP server on port 17832, pi SDK agent sessions, desktop tool wrappers |
| `shared/schemas/` | Canonical TypeScript types for the context snapshot (`desktop-context.ts`) |
| `shared/protocol/` | The localhost HTTP contract (`protocol.md`) — ports, endpoints, error model |

## Development

See [`DEVELOPMENT.md`](DEVELOPMENT.md) for prerequisites, build and test
commands, development workflows, environment variables, and instructions for
refreshing the installed application.

## Use it on Windows

1. Focus any desktop app (Notepad, Explorer, ...).
2. Press **Ctrl+Alt+Space**.
3. Type an instruction, press **Enter**. The overlay closes instantly and
   focus returns to your app.
4. The harness logs show the pinned snapshot, then the agent's answer.

A pi session receives the context summary and screenshot. It can observe the
captured window and use `desktop_act` to focus, click, type, press supported
keys or shortcuts, and scroll. Safe action traces are written to
`logs\host.log`; typed content is never logged. Agent mode requires pi
authentication through `pi /login` or a provider API key.

### Choosing the model

Right-click the tray icon → **Settings…** to pick the agent model and its
reasoning effort. The list shows models with configured authentication, and
effort options adapt to the selected model. The choice persists in
`%LOCALAPPDATA%\pi-os\settings.json`; every new hotkey invocation uses it
(a running task keeps its own model), both switches are logged to
`logs\host.log`.

## Configuration

No environment variables are required for normal use. These optional settings
change user-visible behavior:

| Variable | Meaning |
|----------|---------|
| `PI_OS_HOTKEY` | Hotkey override, e.g. `Ctrl+Shift+F9` (default `Ctrl+Alt+Space`) |
| `PI_OS_INVOKE_TIMEOUT_MS` | Maximum time for each request in milliseconds (default `300000`; `0` disables the timeout) |

Other `PI_OS_*` variables are development and test controls documented in
[`DEVELOPMENT.md`](DEVELOPMENT.md).

Artifacts live under `%LOCALAPPDATA%\pi-os\`: `logs\host.log`,
`captures\shot-*.png`, plus `settings.json` (model + reasoning effort chosen
in the tray settings page).

## Reference files

| File | Read when |
|------|-----------|
| `shared/protocol/protocol.md` | You change any endpoint, port, or message shape |
| `shared/schemas/desktop-context.ts` | You touch the context snapshot shape (C# mirror must stay field-compatible) |
| `AGENTS.md` | You use a coding agent in this repository |

## Current Windows capabilities

- Starts from one desktop shortcut and remains available in the system tray.
- Captures the active window, screenshot, focused UI element, and monitor
  information before showing the prompt.
- Uses a pi agent to inspect and interact with the captured window.
- Supports focusing, clicking, typing, key presses, keyboard shortcuts, and
  scrolling.
- Provides model and reasoning-effort settings from the tray menu.
- Supports cancellation, request timeouts, and live task status.
- Blocks computer input in protected applications such as password managers
  and elevated windows.
